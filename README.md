`profs` is a CLI tool that lets you switch between different profiles for specified directories.

Use cases:

* `work` vs `personal` ssh+git config
* `customer1` vs `customer2` vs `customer3` cloud config
* etc

The idea is to be able to quickly switch profiles without necessarily having to use different computer accounts.

For example, let's say you have different git profiles (email and other diff config). Then you would want to create
different versions of the `~/.gitconfig` file and switch between them. This could be achieved by creating a
`~/.gitconfig.profs/work` and `~/.gitconfig.profs/personal`, and then using `profs` to switch between them.

Let's say you wish to extend this to also have separate ssh configurations. Using `profs`, you would follow the same
pattern and create `~/.ssh.profs/work` and `~/.ssh.profs/personal` directories.

The default `~/.ssh` directory would be a symlink to the active profile directory. To switch all configurations, you
would simply run `profs set work` or `profs set personal`.

WARNING: This is a hack created in about 2 hours. You should probably expect bugs and other issues. There are currently
zero automated tests. Use at your own risk. :)

## Features

- Set and manage profiles for specified directories
- View current configuration and status
- Easy switching between profiles

  help               Help about any command
  list               Lists all detected profiles
  list-profiles      Lists all detected profiles
  migrate-config-dir Migrate legacy /home/johkjo/.profs -> /home/johkjo/.config/gigurra/profs
  remove             Removes a directory from profs config
  reset              Resets all configuration to zero
  set                Set current profile
  status             Show current status
  status-config      Show current raw configuration
  status-full        Show full status and alternatives
  status-profile     Show current profile status

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for profs

Use "profs [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Create auto completion scripts

```
> profs completion fish|bash|zsh|...
```

### Set Profile

To set a profile:

```
> profs set <profile_name>
Setting profile <profile_name> for path <homedir>/.ssh
Setting profile <profile_name> for path <homedir>/.gitconfig
```

This command will set the specified profile for all configured paths.

### View Status

To view the current status:

```
> profs status
Profile: personal
  ~/.ssh           -> ~/.ssh.profs/personal [ok]
  ~/.config/gh     -> ~/.config/gh.profs/personal [ok]
  ~/.config/gcloud -> ~/.config/gcloud.profs/personal [ok]
  ~/.gitconfig     -> ~/.gitconfig.profs/personal [ok]
```

This will show the active profile(s) or indicate if no profiles are active.

### View Full Status

To view the full configuration and alternatives:

```
> profs status-full
<<LOTS-OF-STUFF>>
```

This command displays detailed information about all configured paths and detected profiles.

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file located at `~/.config/gigurra/profs/global.json`.
This file should contain a JSON object with a `paths` array specifying the directories/files to manage.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "paths": [
    "~/.ssh",
    "~/.gitconfig"
  ]
}
```

Either use full absolute paths, or prefix with `~` for your own home dir.

## How It Works

- The tool manages symlinks for the specified paths.
- Profiles are detected in a `.profs` companion directory of each managed path. For example:
    - `~/.ssh` has a companion directory `~/.ssh.profs`, which contains the profiles, e.g., `~/.ssh.profs/work`.
    - `~/.ssh` should be a symlink pointing to `~/.ssh.profs/work`.
- When setting a profile, the tool updates the symlinks to point to the correct profile directory.
